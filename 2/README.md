## Day Two

To solve part one and part two you need to specify the inputs as a `txt` file.

The file should contain a list of comma separated integers.

Your inputs for the this puzzle can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2/input)

The solution to part two also requires a multiplier value, this can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2). The multiplier is an integer value.

```sh
# run tests
python 2/tests.py

# run solution
python 2/main.py <file-containing-inputs> <multiplier>
```
